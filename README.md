## Election Audit Summary   
By creating this code, we can no easily re-use this program to analyze future election results.  Since we are reading data from a .csv file, as long as the .csv comes in the same file configuration, we can re-use our work.  Minor modifications may be required to clean and reorganize the data in the .csv file if it comes in a different format or simply change the column number that we are reading the information from.
